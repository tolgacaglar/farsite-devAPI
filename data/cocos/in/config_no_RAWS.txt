# CROWNSTATE:

# FARSITE_START_TIME: MM DD HHmm
# Where MM is Month (1-12), DD is day of month, HH is hour(0-24) and mm is minute(0-59) of the fire start time.
FARSITE_START_TIME: 05 15 0800

# FARSITE_END_TIME: MM DD HHmm
# Where MM is Month (1-12), DD is day of month, HH is hour(0-24) and mm is minute(0-59) of the fire end time (end of simulation).
FARSITE_END_TIME: 05 16 0800

# FARSITE_TIMESTEP: X
# Where X is the Actual Time Step in minutes. 
# NOTE: there is no Secondary Time Step in the Farsite DLL. 
FARSITE_TIMESTEP: 30

# FARSITE_DISTANCE_RES: X
# Where X is a real number representing the distance resolution. 
# Farsite DLL will check for new fire characteristics when this distance has been covered within a time step.
FARSITE_DISTANCE_RES: 30.0

# FARSITE_PERIMETER_RES: X
# Where X is a real number representing the Farsite Perimeter Resolution. 
# Farsite will have fire vertices every X meters along a perimeter while burning at each time step.
FARSITE_PERIMETER_RES: 90.0

# FARSITE_MIN_IGNITION_VERTEX_DISTANCE: X
# Where X is a floating point number representing the MINIMUM distance between vertices in an ignition. 
# Ignitions shapes with vertices closer than this distance will be thinned to meet this distance parameter. 
# Too many vertices greatly impacts Farsite performance while yielding no changes in results. 
# This switch should be no smaller than 1/4 of the FARSITE_PERIMETER_RES value.
# NOTE: This is an optional switch
# NOTE: Farsite will automatically add vertices to an ignition if the distance between vertices is greater than the FARSITE_PERIMETER_RES value.
# Example:
# FARSITE_MIN_IGNITION_VERTEX_DISTANCE: 15.0

# FARSITE_SPOT_GRID_RESOLUTION: X
# Where integer X is the resolution of the background spotting grid.
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
# NOTE: X should be an integer divisor of the landscape resolution, i.e. if landscape resolution is 30m, 
# X should be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1. 
# The intent is for the background spotting grid to subdivide landscape cells. 
# The background spotting grid is used to prevent more than one spot fire being started in a spotting grid cell, 
# so adjust this parameter to your tolerance for spot fire density.
FARSITE_SPOT_GRID_RESOLUTION: 15.0

# FARSITE_SPOT_PROBABILITY: X
# Where X is a real number from 0.0 - 1.0 representing the probability that an ember can survive to intersect the landscape. 
# This probability check is done after an ember is lofted but before ember flight. 
# Note: Farsite generates a lot of embers. Generally, this probability should not be higher than 0.1 or 
# Farsite will spend a great deal of time resolving perimeters of spots created by embers.
# Example: 
# FARSITE_SPOT_PROBABILITY: 0.05
FARSITE_SPOT_PROBABILITY: 0.0

# SPOTTING_SEED: X
# Where X is a positive integer representing the seed to be used to initialize the random number generator for spotting.
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
SPOTTING_SEED: 253114

# FARSITE_SPOT_IGNITION_DELAY X
# Where X is an integer representing the delay time in minutes before a spot fire is started,
# after an ember lands on a burnable substrate.
# Note: This switch should be set to zero (0) when acceleration is on.
FARSITE_SPOT_IGNITION_DELAY: 0

# FARSITE_MINIMUM_SPOT_DISTANCE: X
# Where X is the distance in meters an ember must travel before it can start a spot fire. 
# This switch was added to speed up Farsite resolving fire polygons that where generally overrun by surface fire spread.
FARSITE_MINIMUM_SPOT_DISTANCE: 30

# FARSITE_ACCELERATION_ON: X
# Where X is either 0 for no acceleration or 1 to use acceleration.
FARSITE_ACCELERATION_ON: 1

# FARSITE_IGNITION_FILE: Filename
# Where Filename is the complete path to the ignition shape file. Example:
# The ignition Filename is not specified here as it is included on the line(s) in the command file
# although it is identified as a "mandatory" switch in farsite-docs.txt...
# NOTE: The shapefile format is a popular digital vector storage format for geographic information system (GIS) software.
#		The shapefile format can spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example, 
#		water wells, rivers, and lakes. Each item can also have attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.
#		The shapefile format lacks the capacity to store topological information, i.e. two polygons representing lakes may overlap.
#		The shapefile format consists of a *collection of files* with a common filename prefix, ALL stored in the same directory!
#		The three mandatory files have filename extensions .shp, .shx, and .dbf, where
#		.shp — shape: the feature geometry itself
#		.shx — shape index: a positional index of the feature geometry to allow seeking forwards and backwards quickly
#		.dbf — attribute format; columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format
# BOTH the *.shp and the *.shx files should be included in the same directory for FARSITE to use the IGNITION file specified
# on the line(s) in the command file otherwise the error message "no ignition" will be given.
#

# FARSITE_IGNITION_FILE: /home/rayman/farsite/cocos/square.shp

# FARSITE_BURN_PERIODS: X
# where X is an integer representing the number of burn period entries, immediately followed by X burn period data entries on X separate lines.
# Format of burn period data entries on each line:
# MM DD HHmm1 HHmm2
# where 
# MM     = month (1-12)
# DD     = the day of the month
# HHmm1  = burn period start hour and minute
# HHmm2  = burn period end hour and minute.
# There can be more than one burn period per day but they must not overlap.
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
# NOTE: if no burn periods are specified, Farsite DLL will burn for the entire simulation period. 

# FARSITE_BARRIER_FILE: Filename
# where Filename is the path to the barrier shape file
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
# NOTE: Farsite DLL does not create a perimeter with barriers as does FARSITE4, but 
# sets the underlying fuels to non-burnable for every pixel in the landscape that the barrier crosses.

# FARSITE_FILL_BARRIERS: X
# Where X is either 0 for false (no barrier fill) or 1 for true (fill the barriers). 
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
# Farsite DLL will set all of the pixels inside a barrier polygon to non-burnable.

# CUSTOM_FUELS_FILE: Filename
# where Filename is the complete path and name of the desired custom fuels file (*.FMD) to use.
# NOTE: this is an optional switch

# CUSTOM_FUELS_UNITS: X
# where X is either Metric or English. 
# NOTE: this is an optional switch and English is the default. 
# Only to be used when CUSTOM_FUELS_DATA switch is used.

# CUSTOM_FUELS_DATA: X
# where X is an integer representing the number of custom fuels data entries, immediately followed by X custom fuels data entries on X separate lines.
# Format of custom fuels data entries on each line must conform to the latest FMD format supported by FlamMap 5 and FARSITE 4 FMD files and of the format
# and are typically of the format (example:)

# where X = the number of fuel model entries
# Format of fuel moisture entries on each line:
# Model  FM1   FM10  FM100   FMLiveHerb   FMLiveWoody
# where
# Model = Fuel Model (1-256) specified on the landscape fuel theme (if no conversions are used).
# Fuel models 1-13 must relate to the original 13 standard fuel models (Anderson 1982)
# FM1   = 1 Hour Fuel Moisture in percent (integer)
# FM10  = 10 Hour Fuel Moisture in percent (integer)
# FM100 = 100 Hour Fuel Moisture in percent (integer)
# FMLiveHerb  = Fuel Moisture of in percent (integer) for "live herbaceous"
# FMLiveWoody = Fuel Moisture of in percent (integer) for "live woody"
# NOTE: Fuel Model 0 is required! This is the default moistures to use when a fuel model is encountered
# in the landscape file (*.LCP) that does not have an entry in the inputs file.
# Data below is "made up" and based on Aug11.FMS from the flatland example in Farsite WIN32

# RAWS_UNITS: X
# Where X is either Metric or English. 
# NOTE: this is an optional switch. English is the default.

# RAWS_ELEVATION: X 
# Where X is an integer representing the elevation of the RAWS data in either feet or meters, depending on the RAWS_UNITS type. 
# NOTE: this is an optional switch. 
# This switch is required when using RAWS for weather (and wind) streams.

# RAWS: X
# Where X is an integer representing the number of RAWS weather records immediately following this entry at one record per line. 
# RAWS entry format:
# Year  Month (1-12)  DayOfMonth  Time (24 hr format)  Temperature  Humidity  Precip Amount  Wind Speed  Wind Direction  Cloud Cover. 
# NOTE: this is an optional switch
# NOTE: the RAWS switch is used to replace the WIND_DATA and WEATHER_DATA switches, combining both into one record type. 
# NOTE: the RAWS data can be specified over a much higher time resolution than the original daily WEATHER_DATA.
#       It causes Farsite no longer to interpolate the WEATHER_DATA (Pcp  mTH  xTH   mT xT   xH mH   Elv   PST  PET), 
#       as original WEATHER_DATA is specified only daily. As a result, Farsite will use the most appropriate RAWS record without 
#       any daily interpolation of temperature, humidity, or rainfall.
# NOTE: The original WIND_DATA (Speed  Direction  CloudCover) does allow hourly data. Hence, use of the RAWS switch is only
#       useful if temperature, humidity, or rainfall needs to be specified on an hourly basis.

# FOLIAR_MOISTURE_CONTENT: X 
# where X is the foliar moisture content in percent. 
# The default is 100 and 100 percent will be used if this switch is not present.
FOLIAR_MOISTURE_CONTENT: 100

# CROWN_FIRE_METHOD: cfmethod 
# where cfmethod is either Finney or ScottRhienhardt
# Note: If not used the Finney crown fire method will be used.
CROWN_FIRE_METHOD: ScottRhienhardt
