Gridded Farsite:


1. Collect ignition --> we generate landscape (.lcp)
2. Collect weather station data - (Maria fire, we have synoptic data, manually collected)
-- TODO: automated weather station data collection
3. Run WindNinja with weather station data input
   -- DONE running from command line
   -- TODO: generating config file programmatically
4. FARSITE RUN:
   -- move all .asc files into a folder (for organization)
   -- generated .atm needs to be fixed (two duplicate lines before and after)
   -- Run gridded farsite --> .shp, google earth file (.kmz) No .kmz output when FARSITE input is .lcp
   -- TODO: convert .shp -> .kmz (Check gdal)
5. Visualizations and Report:
6. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   -- Compare gridded vs non-gridded farsite with the same parameters
   -- Compare gridded wind speed to the weather station data

7. Data Assimilation
  -- Interpolate between the observations
  -- Sample from outside the fire perimeter
  -- Vertex mapping:
	- Match the number of vertices with a reduced resolution of the outside fire (or somewhere in between the inside and outside fires)
	- Turn into a morphing problem
	- Use windninja output and follow a streamline

Also, here are the parameters I'll use for the maria fire (Tomas used 100m since lcp and wind output are at 100m)

# perimeterResolution  = 60m
# distanceResolution   = 30m
# fireacceleration  = true (should keep this true?)
# accelearationtransition = 100m (set this to 30m?)
# ignitionROS = 100 (I don't know what this is, but Tomas set this to 100)
