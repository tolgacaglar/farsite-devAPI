 While all authors agree that the Julian Date starts at zero at 12\+:00 {\itshape noon} of 4713 B.\+C. January 1, the Duffett-\/\+Smith and Meeus algorithms actually yields a JD of 1.\+0 for this date and time! The function here correctly reproduces all the examples in their texts, but yield a JD of 1.\+0 for -\/4712 Jan 1 12\+:00.  While this certainly deviates from the formal definition of JD, I will continue to use this algorithm since I also use their other algorithms for Julian-\/to-\/calendar conversions and astronomical date derivations.
